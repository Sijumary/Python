You are a junior DevOps engineer tasked with diagnosing and resolving a problematic Nginx deployment in a Kubernetes cluster. Your goal is to identify and fix configuration issues preventing the deployment from running correctly.

Preparation
Start and apply the deployment manifest to your Kubernetes cluster:

minikube start
kubectl apply -f ~/project/k8s-manifests/broken-nginx-deployment.yaml
 Explain Code
Tasks
Investigate why the Nginx deployment is not running correctly
Use kubectl commands to diagnose the deployment's issues
Modify the deployment manifest to ensure all replicas are in a running state
Apply the corrected deployment configuration

minikube start

kubectl get deployments
